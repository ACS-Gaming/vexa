Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To ensure that all contributions are legally clean and consistent with the Apache License 2.0
, Vexa requires every contributor (individuals and corporations) to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before their first contribution is merged.

Individuals: please review and sign the [Individual CLA](LA/Individual_CLA.md)
.

Corporations: if you are contributing on behalf of your employer, please have an authorized representative review and sign the [Corporate CLA](CLA/Corporate_CLA.md)
.

ðŸ“Œ How to submit your CLA

Download the appropriate CLA (Individual or Corporate).

Fill in the required fields and sign (digital or scanned signature is fine).

Submit the signed CLA by one of the following methods:

Attach it to a GitHub issue or pull request (preferred), or

Email it to: info@vexa.ai

Once your CLA is on file, all future contributions from you (or your authorized employees, in the case of a corporation) will be automatically covered.
