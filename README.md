# Vexa ‚Äî Real-Time Meeting Transcription API (Meet & Teams) + WebSocket

**Vexa** drops a bot into your online meeting and streams transcripts to your apps in real time.  
- **Platforms:** Google Meet **and Microsoft Teams**  
- **Transport:** REST **or WebSocket (sub-second)**  
- **Run it your way:** Open source & self-hostable, or use the hosted API.

üëâ **Website / Quickstart:** https://vexa.ai/get-started  
üëâ **Self-host guide:** [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)

---

## What's new in v0.6

- **Microsoft Teams support** (alongside Google Meet)
- **WebSocket streaming** for efficient sub-second delivery
- Reliability & joining improvements from real-world usage

> See full release notes: https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa/releases

---

## Quickstart (Hosted)

> Get an API key in minutes at https://vexa.ai/get-started

### 1) Create a bot for **Microsoft Teams**
```bash
# POST /bots
curl -X POST https://<API_HOST>/bots \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "microsoft_teams",
    "meeting_url": "<TEAMS_MEETING_URL>",
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

### 2) Or create a bot for **Google Meet**

```bash
curl -X POST https://<API_HOST>/bots \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "google_meet",
    "meeting_url": "<MEET_URL>",
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

### 3) Stream transcripts over **WebSocket** (sub-second)

```js
// Minimal example; replace placeholders with real values
const url = "wss://<API_HOST>/ws/transcripts?bot_id=<BOT_ID>&token=<API_TOKEN>";
const ws = new WebSocket(url);

ws.onopen = () => console.log("WS connected");
ws.onmessage = (evt) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(evt.data); // {type: "partial"|"final", ts, text, speaker? ...}
  console.log(msg.type, msg.text);
};
ws.onclose = () => console.log("WS closed");
ws.onerror = (e) => console.error("WS error", e);
```

### 4) (Optional) Poll over REST

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
  "https://<API_HOST>/transcripts/<platform>/<native_meeting_id>"
```

## Quickstart (Self-Host)

Open-source, privacy-first self-hosting with Docker Compose / Nomad.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa.git
cd vexa
cp env-example.cpu .env  # or env-example.gpu
make all                 # builds & starts services locally
```

* Full guide: [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)
* Then use the same API calls as the hosted quickstart (pointing to your host).

---

## Who this is for

* **Enterprises (Self-host):** Data sovereignty & control; deploy on your infra.
* **SMB / Teams using hosted API:** Fastest path from meeting to transcript.
* **n8n & indie builders:** Zero/low-code automations powered by real-time transcripts.

  * n8n tutorial: https://vexa.ai/blog/google-meet-transcription-n8n-workflow

---

## Roadmap (short)

* Zoom support (public preview next)
* Docs polish for WS message schema, retry/back-pressure examples
* Latency methodology & benchmarks blog

## Build on Top. In Hours, Not Months

**Build powerful meeting assistants (like Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, Fathom) for your startup, internal use, or custom integrations.**

The Vexa API provides powerful abstractions and a clear separation of concerns, enabling you to build sophisticated applications on top with a safe and enjoyable coding experience.

For instance, the **Vexa Example Client** (see [Projects Built with Vexa](BUILT-WITH-VEXA.md)) was built in just 3 hours of live coding with Cursor, showcasing the rapid development possible with Vexa.

Furthermore, with our **n8n integration** (see [Projects Built with Vexa](BUILT-WITH-VEXA.md) for examples), you can create incredibly complex workflows with no code, leveraging real-time transcription from Google Meet (with support for other platforms coming soon).

## Self-Deployment

For **security-minded companies**, Vexa offers complete **self-deployment** options.

To run Vexa locally on your own infrastructure, the primary command you'll use after cloning the repository is `make all`. This command sets up the environment (CPU by default, or GPU if specified), builds all necessary Docker images, and starts the services.
